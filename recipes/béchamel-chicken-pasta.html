    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This béchamel chicken pasta recipe is a tweak on a typical Middle Eastern béchamel pasta. It consists of chicken breast, penne pasta, vegetables, and herbs, and is topped with a luscious béchamel and mozzarella cheese. It's baked until nice and bubbly.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package dried penne pasta</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed</li>
        <li>1 bunch cilantro</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can Italian-flavored tomato paste</li>
        <li>½ cup frozen peas</li>
        <li>½ cup water, or more or less as needed</li>
        <li>3 sprigs fresh dill, chopped</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 cube chicken bouillon</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 cups milk</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion, bell pepper, and garlic; cook until tender. Stir in chicken; cook until almost cooked through. Stir in cilantro, tomato paste, peas, enough water to make a thick sauce, and dill; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear, and mixture is heated through. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add bouillon cube; stir until dissolved. Stir in flour until smooth, stirring constantly. Stir in milk; season with black pepper. Continue cooking and stirring until béchamel sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.</li>
        <li>Combine penne and ½ béchamel sauce in a bowl. Transfer ½ penne mixture to a baking dish; layer with ½ chicken mixture, and ½ mozzarella cheese. Layer with remaining each ½ penne mixture, ½ chicken mixture, and ½ béchamel sauce. Top with remaining ½ mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 30 minutes. </li>
