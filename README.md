# Odin Recipes

This project is a simple HTML-only webpage, created to test my current ability to build a page and apply everything I've learned so far.

## What I Learned

### What is HTML?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a document format that tells web browsers how to display content intended for the web.

## Elements

The main way a browser reads and interprets content is through elements. Every element has a specific meaning that tells the browser how to handle and display it.

For example:

   * The <p> element is interpreted as a paragraph.

   * The <h1> element is read as a header.

Even though these might look similar at a glance, they serve very different purposes behind the scenes. The key isn’t memorizing every tag, **but rather understanding how the browser interprets each element**.

Hopefully, this project will help demonstrate the concepts I’ve learned.
