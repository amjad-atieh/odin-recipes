This project is a simple HTML only page, meant to test my abilty so far to make a page and utilize everything I have learned.

# what I learned

## what is HTML
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it is a decument that dectates how web browsers display the documents meant to be a web page.

## elemnts
The main way to read the input is through elements, every elemnt has a meaning reagrding hoe to interpet the input, for examble if I using the <p> element the browser will interpet this as a paragraph, and <h1> will be header, even though they may seem similar at first glance everything they are read very differently from the browser's side, and that is what is imprtant, not knowing every tag, but rather understanding how they are interpeted, which hopefully I will domentrate the concepets on this page.
